    """Implements a Neural Renderer with an implicit scene representation that
    allows both forward and inverse rendering.

    The forward pass from 3d scene to 2d image is (rendering):
    Scene representation (input) -> ResNet3d -> Projection -> ResNet2d ->
    Rendered image (output)

    The inverse pass from 2d image to 3d scene is (inverse rendering):
    Image (input) -> ResNet2d -> Inverse Projection -> ResNet3d -> Scene
    representation (output)

    Args:
        img_shape (tuple of ints): Shape of the image input to the model. Should
            be of the form (channels, height, width).
        channels_2d (tuple of ints): List of channels for 2D layers in inverse
            rendering model (image -> scene).
        strides_2d (tuple of ints): List of strides for 2D layers in inverse
            rendering model (image -> scene).
        channels_3d (tuple of ints): List of channels for 3D layers in inverse
            rendering model (image -> scene).
        strides_3d (tuple of ints): List of channels for 3D layers in inverse
            rendering model (image -> scene).
        num_channels_inv_projection (tuple of ints): Number of channels in each
            layer of inverse projection unit from 2D to 3D.
        num_channels_projection (tuple of ints): Number of channels in each
            layer of projection unit from 2D to 3D.
        mode (string): One of 'bilinear' and 'nearest' for interpolation mode
            used when rotating voxel grid.

    Notes:
        Given the inverse rendering channels and strides, the model will
        automatically build a forward renderer as the transpose of the inverse
        renderer.
